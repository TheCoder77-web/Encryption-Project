Once upon a time, there was a brave knight named Adrian Camacho. He had an evil twin brother named Steven Zou. Their parents were Queen Saez, and King Herman, and they ruled over the beautifully lovely kingdom of Kirkland. Unfortunately, Steven was envious of Adrian, so on his wedding night, Princess Ainzat was brutally murdered and skinned alive. Adrian was devastated, and this embarked his journey to get revenge on Steven, and bring his wife back to life.

Steven relocated to the icy mountains. In the mountains, Leo and Ruien were two freaking tanks of nature who would protect Steven. Adrian got brutally pummeled into nothing but atoms. But then Steven was sad to have no brother. 

Steven revived his brother, and in the end, the brothers made out, and Adrian realized; Maybe true love was the unbreakable bond between the two. A partner is unnecessary. But a twin is essential.
